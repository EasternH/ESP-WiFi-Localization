# ESP-WiFi-Localization
> 这个项目是基于ESP32的WiFi-RSSI室内定位。这是我在上科大上的CS222的一门课的课设。最初的想法是读了RADAR的这篇文章后，有了这个想法，之前我用过ESP32，里面的硬件自带测量RSSI参数的功能。所以我对其进行了修改。做起来这个还是挺麻烦的，以为采集很多数据是用手机一点点记录下来的（其实主要是我不会写手机端的接收代码..）

* ESP-IDF的版本大概是2.0左右，也用了ESP-MDF。
* 使用说明在Code-and-environment中。
* Paper中是一些看过的论文，主要是RADAR的。
* Picture中是我用手机记录的东西。
* Report就是我的最后一些结果之类的。

> This project is based on ESP32 WiFi-RSSI indoor positioning. This is the course design of a CS222 course I took at Shanghai University of Science and Technology. The original idea was that after reading this article by RADAR, I had this idea. I used ESP32 before, and the hardware in it has the function of measuring RSSI parameters. So I modified it. It is quite troublesome to do this. I thought that collecting a lot of data was recorded with a mobile phone a little bit (in fact, I don’t know how to write the receiving code on the mobile phone..)

* The version of ESP-IDF is about 2.0, and ESP-MDF is also used.
* Instructions for use are in Code-and-environment.
* In Paper are some papers that have been read, mainly RADAR.
* Picture is what I recorded with my mobile phone.
* Report is my final results and so on.
